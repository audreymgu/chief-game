	<p>You've completed a playthrough of our initial prototype! This is roughly the halfway point of the game in terms of total play time.</p>
	<p>If you'd like to restart and see how different choices might affect your next playthough, press the restart button at the top. Even making the same choice can sometimes lead to different results. Thank you for playing!</p>
